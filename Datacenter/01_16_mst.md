# Multiple Spanning-Tree Protocol (MST), IEEE 802.1s

IEEE 802.1s originally started as Cisco’s Multiple Instances Spanning Tree Protocol (MISTP). Remember that RapidPVST+ each VLAN is mapped to a single spanning tree instance. When you have 200 VLANs, it means there are 200 instances of spanning tree. This requires a lot of CPU power and memory. You can put multiple VLANs together in something called an instance. The end result is that you would have fewer instances of spanning-tree which results in a higher scalability. MST (802.1s) relies on RSTP (802.1W).

### How IEEE 802.1s (MST) Works

In order to improve the convergence time of STP (or CST), IEEE released IEEE 802.1w standard. With this

With MST, the topology calculation is done by RSTP. MST works by decoupling VLANs and STP Instances. The network administrator will define the VLAN to instance mapping. By default, all VLANs belong to default MST0 (AKA Common Internal Spanning Tree or CIST or IST). When two switches have the same instance-to-VLAN mapping database, the same instance name, and then same instance revision number, we say that they are in the same region.

When two switches are in the same MST region (intra-region), they know the detail of their region as a result MST forms within the region. Undefined VLANs fall into MST0

Figure 1: SW1 and SW2 are in the same MST Region

When two switches are in different regions (inter-region), they don’t have the details of the other region. The two regions see each other as virtual bridges. The result is that they run RSTP for inter-region calculation. Intra-region MST Instances are collapsed into MST0.

### MST and CST Inter-Operation

From inside MST you might have different topologies based on which ports are in forwarding mode and which ports are alternate. This is what you see in the middle to top of the image below

From CST point of view, the MST region looks like a single switch. This is what you see in the middle and bottom of the image below

## Workshop: MST Configuration

N9K01, N9K02, and N9K03 connect together in a triangle topology:

#### Verification

Let’s check if the configuration on all switches are the same. I am going to show you the configuration on N9K01 and N9K03.
<details>

<summary>N9K03</summary>

```elixir
N9K01(config)# show spanning-tree mst configuration digest
Name      [SMENODE-DC01]
Revision  1     Instances configured 1
Digest          0x8b5d98ca042bad0d7fa5f18744f4755d
Pre-std Digest  0x73a6b19dfef58d4d5957bd6ff44a4515
```
</details>

<details>

<summary>N9K03</summary>

```elixir
N9K03(config)# show spanning-tree mst configuration digest
Name      [SMENODE-DC01]
Revision  1     Instances configured 1
Digest          0x8b5d98ca042bad0d7fa5f18744f4755d
Pre-std Digest  0x73a6b19dfef58d4d5957bd6ff44a4515
```
</details>

As you can see the MST digest for both switches are identical. Hence, we can say that they are in the same region. Now, let’s verify the topology:
