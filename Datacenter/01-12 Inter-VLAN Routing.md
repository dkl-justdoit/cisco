# Inter-VLAN Routing

Although we can route between two VLANs with a router 802.1Q trunk (Router-On-A-Stick AKA ROAS), but that is not in the scope of our CCIE Data Center curriculum; instead, we are going to cover how IVR works with a Cisco Nexus switch.

This is facilitated by creating a Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) which is a logical interface in a particular VLAN (or simply a VLAN interface). You can simply create an SVI by employing `interface vlan vlan-id` global command. Note that this interface is a TCP/IP Layer-3 routed interface. You can then assign an IP address under the interface configuration. That IP address will be the default gateway of your hosts in that VLAN.

### How to Configure IVR
To configure IVR, you only need to create the SVIs and give them their IP addresses. In order to create an SVI, you would need to enable the feature on NX-OS (Nexus Operating System). In the example below, I have created two SVIs, one for each VLAN 100 and VLAN 200. Remember that these SVIs can be the default gateway of their respective VLANs:

<pre>
N9K01# <b><ins>configure</ins></b>
N9K01(config)#<b><ins>feature interface-vlan</ins></b>

N9K01(config)# <b><ins>vlan 100</ins></b>
N9K01(config-vlan)# <b><ins>name VLAN100</ins></b>
N9K01(config)# <b><ins>vlan 200</ins></b>
N9K01(config-vlan)# <b><ins>name VLAN200</ins></b>

N9K01(config)# <b><ins>interface Vlan 100</ins></b>
N9K01(config-if)# <b><ins>no shutdown</ins></b>
N9K01(config-if)# <b><ins>ip address 192.168.100.1/24</ins></b>

N9K01(config)# <b><ins>interface Vlan 200</ins></b>
N9K01(config-if)# <b><ins>no shutdown</ins></b>
N9K01(config-if)# <b><ins>ip address 192.168.200.1/24</ins></b>
</pre>

From this point, we donâ€™t need to do anything further as the SVIs are Layer-3 interfaces and they will appear as *attached* in the routing table.

<pre>
N9K01# <b><ins>show ip route</ins></b>
IP Route Table for VRF "default"
'*' denotes best ucast next-hop
'**' denotes best mcast next-hop
'[x/y]' denotes [preference/metric]
'%<string>' in via output denotes VRF <string>

<b>192.168.100.0/24, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached
    *via 192.168.100.1, Vlan100, [0/0], 00:14:34, direct</b>
192.168.100.1/32, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached
    *via 192.168.100.1, Vlan100, [0/0], 00:14:34, local
<b>192.168.200.0/24, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached
    *via 192.168.200.1, Vlan200, [0/0], 00:14:03, direct</b>
192.168.200.1/32, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached
    *via 192.168.200.1, Vlan200, [0/0], 00:14:03, local
</pre>

NX-OS can now perform IVR between the two VLANs.

### SVI Autostate

When you create an SVI, there is a calculation based on which the switch decides to mark the interface as up/up or down/down state. Here is the summary of the calculation:

  * Is there at least one access port in that VLAN whose status is up/up? If yes, the SVI is also up/up
  * Is there any trunk port for that VLAN in forwarding state? If yes, the SVI is also up/up

In this post, you will learn how to change this default expectation and exclude some interfaces or all interfaces from that calculation and make it up/up always regardless of the state of trunk or access port of its VLAN. Why you might need this? One reason that you might want an SVI be always up/up even if it does not meet the aforementioned conditions, is that you want to reach its IP from another Layer-3 domain even if there is no host in than VLAN. Here are three ways you can configure autostate.

  * Under the physical interface or portchannel itself
  * Globally for all interfaces
  * Per SVI basis

#### Exclude SVI autostate under the physical interface or portchannel

Here is an example of how we exclude an Ethernet interface from the calculation

<pre>
N9K01# <b><ins>configure</ins></b>
N9K01(config)# <b><ins>interface ethernet 1/1</ins></b>
N9K01(config-if)# <b><ins>switchport autostate exclude</ins></b>
</pre>

#### Negate SVI autostate globally for all interfaces

Below is an example of how to disable the autostate calculation globally by default

<pre>
N9K01# <b><ins>configure</ins></b>
N9K01(config)# <b><ins>no system default interface-vlan autostate</ins></b>
</pre>

#### Negate SVI autostate per SVI basis

Here is an example of how to disable autostate feature per SVI itself

<pre>
N9K01# <b><ins>configure</ins></b>
N9K01(config)# <b><ins>interface vlan 100</ins></b>
N9K01(config-if)# <b><ins>no autostate</ins></b>
</pre>

## Workshop

In this lab, we are going to configure the IVR between VLAN 100 and VLAN 200.
