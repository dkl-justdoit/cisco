# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

Border-Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an extremely scalable routing protocol which gives you a lot of control to choose the best route. It is a path-vector, which unlike OSPF where routers individually run SPF algorithm on their Link-State Database, it advertises the routes to the network.

BGP connects two autonomous systems (AS) to teach other. There is two different formats with AS Numbers (ASN): 16-bit and 32-bit. Table below depicts the ASN assignment by IANA

| AS Number   | Reason For reservation                                                                                     |

*Table 1: 16-Bit ASN Assignment Categories from IANA*

Border Gateway Protocol uses Path Attributes (PA) to make decision for choosing a route over another. BGP can advertise these PAs along with each prefix (prefix is called a Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)). It uses a process called the best path selection process to choose the best route between two routes.

### BGP Path Attributes

Table below shows the different BGP PAs:
| Attribute Class          | Scope and Examples                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Well-known mandatory     | Must be recognized by all routers.<br>Must be included with every prefix advertisement.<br>AS_PATH, origin, next hop                |
| Well-known discretionary | Must be recognized by all routers.<br>May or may not be included with a prefix advertisement.<br>local preference, atomic aggregate |
| Optional transitive      | Might or might not be recognized by a router<br>Stay with the route advertisement from AS to AS:<br>aggregator, community           |
| Optional non-transitive  | Might or might not be recognized by a router.<br>Cannot be shared from AS to AS.<br>MED, RR originator ID, RR cluster list          |

*Table 2: BGP Path Attributes*

You will later learn what these PAs are and how BGP selects the routes by these PAs. But for now, Let’s start with AS_PATH which is a well-known mandatory attribute. You can think of it as a hop count, but the hop here is the entire AS. This PA performs two key functions for us:

  * By default, the shortest AS_PATH (Fewest number of ASNs listed) is best path.
  * Prevent loop

### BGP Sessions and Messages

BGP sessions are point-to-point and unicast over TCP 179.

Here is the list of BGP messages. No Hello!

* Open
  * Sends after TCP session established to request a BGP session open.
* Keepalive
  * Periodically (every 60 seconds) sends after the BGP session open.
  * Hold timer is 180 seconds.
* Update
  * This message includes the NLRIs and PAs.
* Notification
  * Sends whenever an error occurs or once hold timer expires.
  * After sending notification message, BGP always closes the session.

### eBGP and iBGP

* External BGP (eBGP): when two routers in two different autonomous systems exchange BGP routing information.
  * Advertising router updates the AS_PATH by prepending its ASN to the AS_PATH variable.
  * Receiving router checks the AS_PATH and discards the NLRI if it contains the ASN that matches its local ASN.
  * TTL value with eBGP defaults to 1. If your peer is not directly connected, you must increase the TTL by `ebgp-multihop N` command.
* Internal BGP (iBGP): when two routers in the same autonomous systems exchange routing information.
  * The purpose of iBGP is to get the routes from one edge to another edge maintaining the BGP attributes.
  * BGP split-horizon is loop prevention mechanism in iBGP. It says that don’t forward routes learned from an iBGP peer to another iBGP peer.
  * RFC4274 says when sending a message to an iBGP peer, if the route is not locally originated, the BGP speaker SHOULD NOT modify the NEXT_HOP attribute (NEXT_HOP is a well-known mandatory attribute).

|                           | iBGP          | eBGP    |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Update AS_PATH attribute? | No            | Yes     |
| Loop Prevention Mechanism | Split-horizon | AS_PATH |
| Change Next-hop?          | No            | Yes     |
| Default TTL Value         | 255           | 1       |
| Metric                    | 200           | 20      |

*Table 3: iBGP versus eBGP*

Here is basic configuration example of eBGP

```tex
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)# feature bgp
N9K01(config)# router bgp 65000
N9K01(config-router)# neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65001
```

Here is an example of how we can change the TTL with eBGP from default 1 to 2. Meaning that our peer is 2 hops away.

```c
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)#router bgp 65000
N9K01(config-router)# neighbor 10.1.1.1
N9K01(config-router-neighbor)# ebgp-multihop 2
```

Here is a sample configuration of iBGP

```vala
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)# feature bgp
N9K01(config)# router bgp 65000
N9K01(config-router)# neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65000
```

Here is how we can change the Next-hop attribute on an iBGP edge router:

```tcsh
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)# router bgp 65000
N9K01(config-router-neighbor)# address-family ipv4 unicast
N9K01(config-router-neighbor-af)# next-hop-self
```
