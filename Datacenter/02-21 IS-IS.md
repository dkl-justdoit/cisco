# Intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS)

Intermediate system to intermediate system (Short for IS-IS) is an IGP link-state protocol which builds a link-state database. It was originally developed for routing the International ISO Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) packets Like OSPF.

  * Defined in ISO/IEC 10589, RFC 1142, RFC 1195, and RFC 2763.
  * It will the run the Dijkstra SPF algorithm to find the best path to the destination.
  * IS-IS has an AD of 115 with Cisco NX-OS.

Unlike OSPF, IS-IS does not run over network layer. It encapsulates IS-IS messages directly into data-link frames.

ISIS can exchange any information not just IPv4 routes. You can even exchange MAC addresses or IPv6. With TLV (Type, Length, Value) fields in ISIS packets, the protocol does not to be rewritten.


# What are CLNS and CLNP


Equivalent of IP/IPv6 to TCP/IP is Connectionless-mode Network Protocol (CLNP) to OSI model. IP connects the ** *hosts* ** by a ** *router* **. CLNP connects the ** *End-Systems (ES)* ** by an ** *Intermediary-System (IS)* **.

Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) is a service that CLNP provides to route messages to their destinations. CLNP provides a set of services known as Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS). CLNS runs over CLNP and refers to a router’s operation including IS-IS on OSI connectionless mode. In CLNS:

  * hosts talk to each other using CLNP (not IP)
  * hosts talk to router using ES-IS protocol
  * Intermediary-systems talk to each other using IS-IS or ISIS

### Network Service Access Point (NSAP)

Network Service Access Point (NSAP) addressing is what we use in OSI networks. Unlike IP where you assign the address directly to the interface, with NSAP you assign the address to the entire node.

#### NSAP Addressing Scheme

The length for NSAP is minimum of 8 and maximum of 20 Bytes.

  <figcaption>Figure 1: NSAP Addressing Format</figcaption>
</figure>


If 39<=AFI<=49, it is reserved for private networks by ISO. 47 and 49 are popularly used for IP private domains.

SEL field also called an NSAP Selector or NSEL is always 00 for IS. In this case – with SEL=0 – the NSAP address is called Network Entity Title (NET).

Within the area we only use system ID as part of SPF calculation

Here are some example of NET addresses:

* NET: 49.0001.0000.0000.1111.00
  * Area is: 49.0001
  * System ID is 0000.0000.1111
  * Selector: 00

### Levels of Routing in OSI Networks

* Level 0 routing (ES-IS):
  * Routing between an End System (host) and its IS (router); In IP world we have Proxy ARP, IPv6 ND, or default gateway.
* Level 1 routers:
  * Analogous to OSPF non-backbone Internal Routers
* Level 2 routers:
  * Analogous to OSPF backbone Internal Routers
  * Usually a single L2 area in Service Provides
* Level1/Level2 outers:
  * Analogous to OSPF ABRs.
  * Default router type is this type with NX-OS
* Level 3 routing:
  * Analogous to BGP in TCP/IP world
  * MPBGP obsoletes L3 routing even with OSI

```io  
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)# feature isis
N9K01(config)# router isis 1
N9K01(config-router)# net 49.0001.0000.0000.1111.00
N9K01(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast

N9K01(config-router-af)# exit
N9K01(config-router)# is-type level-1
N9K01(config-router)# log-adjacency-changes
N9K01(config)# interface ethernet 1/1
N9K01(config-if)# ip router isis 1
N9K01(config-if)# ip address 10.1.1.1/31
```

### IS-IS Network Types

With IS-IS we only have two network types:

  * Broadcast:
    * Uses Designated Intermediate System (DIS) instead of DR/BDR.
      * DIS election
        * IS-IS elects a designated intermediate system (DIS) on broadcast and multi-access networks
	    * Interface priority can be from 0 – 127
		  * 64 is default
		  * Zero, the router never become DIS
	  * In a priority tie, the system with the highest SNPA (fancy name for MAC address) wins DIS election
    * Unlike OSPF, the adjacency is full mesh between all the neighbors
    * Unlike OSPF, no backup DIS
  * Point-to-point
    * Most case in Datacenter network. So, we will change our network types to point-to-point to suppress the DIS election process.

To form an adjacency, the network types must match.

```tcl
! Configure point-to-point network type
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)# interface ethernet 1/1
N9K01(config-if)# medium p2p
! Configure broadcast network type
N9K01# configure terminal
N9K01(config)# interface ethernet 1/1
N9K01(config-if)# medium broadcast
```

### IS-IS Adjacencies

IS-IS sends Hello PDUs every 10 seconds. The default Hello multiplier is 3, resulting a Hold time of 30 seconds. To form an adjacency, MTU, Network type, and level of adjacency must match. In case of L1 adjacency, area also must match.

* L1-only routers form L1 adjacencies with L1 and L1/L2 neighbors – only if their AIDs match.
* L2-only routers form L2 adjacencies with L2 and L1/L2 neighbors – even if their AIDs don’t match.
* Two L1/L2 Routers form both L1 and L2 adjacencies if their AIDs match.
* Two L1/L2 routers form only an L2 adjacency if their AIDs do not match.

### IS-IS Adjacency States

  * **Down:** The initial state.
  * **Initializing:** IS-IS neighbor received IS-IS Hellos, but it is not certain that the neighbor is properly receiving this router’s Hellos.
  * **Up:** IS-IS neighbor received IS-IS Hellos, and it is certain that the neighbor is properly receiving this router’s Hellos.
